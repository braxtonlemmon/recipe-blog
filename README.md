# Recipe Blog API
Project based on The Odin Project NodeJS [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/blog-api). The project involves creating a backend API that will be used by two frontend sites. The result is a recipe blog in which the administrator can modify the blog and all other users can view and comment on recipe posts.

# Objectives
- Use the MERN stack to create a fully functional app.
- Use MongoDB Mongoose for the backend database.
- Use Express to create the backend API.
- Use ReactJS create-react-app for the frontend sites.
